Simulation Parameters Used (Default)
------------------------------------
Number of Buses:           5
Number of Stops:           15
Inter-stop Travel Time:    5 minutes
Passenger Arrival Rate:    2.5 passengers/minute
Boarding Time:             2 seconds/passenger
Simulation Horizon:        8 hours
Hold Policy:               Enabled (MAX_HOLD_SEC = 90, ALPHA = 1.0)
Random Seed:               42

Notes:
These default values were used for the main experimental comparison 
between the baseline (no control) and hold (headway control) policies.

--------------------------------------------------------
Additional Test Scenarios (Exploratory Runs)
--------------------------------------------
# Scenario A – Increased Passenger Demand
Number of Buses:           5
Passenger Arrival Rate:    3.5 passengers/minute
Observation: Higher demand increased queue lengths, 
making the hold policy even more beneficial.

# Scenario B – Reduced Fleet Size
Number of Buses:           3
Passenger Arrival Rate:    2.5 passengers/minute
Observation: Fewer buses resulted in longer headways 
and higher passenger wait times under both policies.

# Scenario C – Higher Bus Frequency
Number of Buses:           7
Passenger Arrival Rate:    2.5 passengers/minute
Observation: More buses reduced queues but caused mild bunching 
in the baseline case; hold policy stabilized spacing effectively.

# Scenario D – Shorter Travel Time
Inter-stop Travel Time:    3 minutes
Observation: Faster travel slightly reduced queues but increased 
headway variability without control.

Parameter Control Notes
--------------------------------------------
All parameters were provided as command-line arguments at runtime. 
Example:
java -cp . BusSim --hours 8 --seed 42 --mode hold --maxHoldSec 90 --alpha 1.0

No external input files are required for execution.
All output data (headways, queues, bus loads) are generated automatically
as CSV files within the working directory.
